## Web Development Basics

Before diving into React, we must have a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You are encouraged to be comfortable making changes to code and looking up unfamiliar concepts. Familiarity with Git and Command line interface is a plus.

## Code Editor

A code editor is essential. My recommendation is **Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, which is free and available on MacOS, Linux, and Windows. If you prefer another code editor, that's fine too. Use the one you're most effective and comfortable with.

## Browser

Weâ€™ll need a modern web browser. **Mozilla Firefox**, **Google Chrome**, or **Microsoft Edge** (Windows Edge), feel free to use any of these browsers, but note that some React developer tools are only available on Chrome and Firefox.
